## Overview
This project introduces a non-contact, video-based approach for estimating heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) from short videos of the human neck. We evaluated six widely-used video-based pulse extraction methods:

- **GREEN**
- **CHROM** (Chrominance-based)
- **POS** (Plane-Orthogonal-to-Skin)
- **OMIT** (Orthogonal Matrix Image Transformation)
- **ICA** (Independent Component Analysis)
- **LGI** (Local Group Invariance)

All extracted signals were validated against **synchronized ECG** recordings. We also developed a robust, adaptive peak detection algorithm for estimating HR and HRV in noisy video-based signals.
